The list goes on.\nAnyway, I've been tasked with finding a new payroll provider. Hoping for one that does all the things I listed in my issues with Square, as well as 401K integration. If it includes other functions to streamline or automate HR / OPS / IT type tasks, even better. Would be a benefit if it integrates with QB. It must include the same tax prep/filing as Square and other platforms as well.\nI was looking at Gusto and feeling like it could be good, but now reading a lot of not great reviews and getting cold feet about moving forward. I used Paychex in the past for another role and they had plenty of issues, but still far exceed Square. Any suggestions appreciated!",

Can I pay myself if I go through the contractor only bundle?   \n  \nDoes anyone have better recommendations out there?  \nAny help is really appreciated. ",
    "content": "I tried to schedule calls with Gusto product specialists twice and they've blown me off both times. I hear great things about the product, but am really turned off by the experience so far.  \nIf there's anyone here who uses or used Gusto recently, I'm really interested to understand how it would be better than going through my accountant to pay the 1-2 contractors I have started using in my consulting business.   \n1. how is it different than my accountant cutting checks/is it in platform or does it go through a bill-pay system/does it increase compliance in any way?  \n2. what's the difference between the contractor option and the regular option? Can I pay myself if I go through the contractor only bundle?   \n  \nDoes anyone have better recommendations out there?  \nAny help is really appreciated. ",

    "text": "I've been happily with Gusto for about 10 years now and have genuinely had nothing but very positive experiences so far. I know there are mixed feelings across Reddit about Gusto, but I've been pretty well treated and never had any issues.\n\nI had one minor blip this past week when a staff member changed their bank account information right before payroll processed. The payment didn't arrive, and it was an error with the staff member's banking info. I received messages from Gusto about whats going on, passed them along to the staff member, and nothing has been resolved a week later.\n\nI requested a call today to try and figure out if there is anything I need to do because nothing appears in my dashboard, or the staff members dashboard. The \"person\" who called was way too competent, spoke way too fast, and spoke in ways that were clearly not normal. After about a minute, I told them I do not like talking to robots or AI. They flat out denied being a robot or AI and then kept going with solution identification. There was absolutely no possible way that whatever I was talking to was human because they did everything so fast, hardly paused at all after I spoke, and pronounced the name of the staff member differently each time. \n\nAt the end of the call, the AI agent asked, \"anything else I can do?\" I responded by saying \"please submit feedback to your supervisor that I do not want to speak with AI robots\". It rebutted back, denying it was AI and apologized that it \"could not convince me\" that it was not AI and then instantly hung up.\n\nWhile I believe my solution was resolved (lets see in a few days) without having to repeat myself, this was not a positive experience to me. \n\nIf you're going to use AI, just admit it. Don't gaslight me or deny it after I call you out on it.\n\nI get that this is the future of support technology, but own it. Their online AI chat is named \"Gus\" which is appropriate. But don't phone me and act like you're human when you're clearly not.",

    "text": "Small company, NJ based. about 7 remote employees (multi-state), the rest onsite, in office warehouse/office hybrid space. 24 hour warehouse, 5-6 shifts.\n\nWhat we currently use:  \nGusto - for payroll and some light onboarding workflows.  \nConnecteam - for company updates (primarily for warehouse updates) and for time tracking  \nATS - None.\n\nWhat I need:  \nI want an all in one, we don't need a crazy extensive ATS, but definitely more than what Gusto offers.  \nI want one system, cost effective, that works for self service onboarding (simple interface app), clocking in/out, payroll, communication/announcements, team members chat with HR, space for notes, documents etc etc. we also have some temp agency employees i need to enter into system for time tracking only.\n\nWhy I need change: what we have is not terrible. but its not scalable. I have to onboard employees on two different apps. connecteam is OK, but we have a lower tier so i can't customize the way I want, but its not worth the upgrade imho, because the biggest issue I have is the way overnight shifts calculate (total hours calculate by calendar date, not by shift). its confusing for the employees, for supervisors to approve, and for me.\n\nWhat i'm currently considering: Fingercheck vs Homebase\n\ni've used Fingercheck before. has most of what i need. super customizable, love the customized reports. I have very little experience with their team chat or their ATS. has a workaround to exclude temp employees from payroll even if they have app access. multistate payroll\n\nHomebase - doing a little demo today but from what I can see, its the same, with an easy interface, seems user friendly. Homebase doesn't auto calculate wage garnishments. not an issue right now but could be a pain in the long run . can have temps for time tracking. multistate payroll\n\nboth have decent price range. keeps us under 8 K for the year. estimating 70 FTEs.\n\nThoughts? or other Suggestions?",

Ang pasok ko ay 7 am - 5 pm and medyo may kalayuan ang inuuwian ko sa trabaho ko. So, umaalis po ako ng 6 am and nakakauwi ako ng 6 pm din, from monday to friday lang pero compressed. \n\n1st Q. Kakayanin ko po kaya mag working reviewee sa ganitong schedule? If yes po, pwede po bang bigyan nyo ako ng payo kung paano ang dapat kong gawin? Kase po gustong-gusto ko na mag review ayoko na po patagalin \ud83d\ude2d \nActually gusto ko nga sana magfull time reviewee kaso hindi pwede since ako ang nagsu-support sa sarili ko at tulong kame ng mama ko sa pag aaral ng mga kapatid ko. Pero next year kase, college na yung isa and syempre po ayoko iasa sa mama ko ang tuition at needs nya sa school. Gusto ko sana kanya na yung kita nya since may binabayaran syang utang.  \n\n\n2nd Q. Qualified na kaya ako maghanap at mag-apply ng trabaho sa ibang company na work from home set-up o kahit once a week RTO lang? Para sana makapag provide pa rin ako kahit nagrereview ako. \nwag nyo po sana ako i-judge na ito palang yung kaya ko matulong sa mama ko since I am earning 15 - 17k monthly lang po and gumagastos po ako ng meds ko for colostomy. \n\nAng task ko naman is invoicing, paggawa ng sales book, CDB, CRB and PB, Ledgers and FS, inventory management and nag-aassist tuwing may audit. Ipinaubaya na rin saken yung tax filing ng EWT, WTX on Competition, VAT at FBT. \n\n\nPlease po, kahit advice po sa kung ano sng mas maganda kong gawin huhu kase gulong-gulo na rin po ako. \n\nThank you much po sa mga Sasagot and Congratulations po sa mga nakatapos na ng October 2025 CPALE \u2764\ufe0f\n",
